## Budget Manager

The **intent** of the Budget Manager application is to provide a 
user-friendly system that helps manage one's expenses. Within the application
the user will be able to catalog their expenses by month and category. 
As of this moment, the categories are constrained to the following: food, rent, medical, 
clothing, and entertainment. However, in later versions of the application this will 
be updated so that the user can create their own classification categories. 

Furthermore, at any point in time, the user will be able to view the total money they 
have spent for any given month. On top of that, they can also view the total money 
spent for any given category in any given month.

As of now, the application has a console based interface. Whenever the user wants 
to see their monthly totals or monthly totals per category, the dollar amount will print
to the console. However, in later versions, the app will provide the user with 
more pleasing visualizations of their expenses (histograms, line-plots, etc.)

The app is made to be **used** by a range of users.
Anyone who is interested in having access to an easy way 
of tracking their monthly budget/expenses should be able to use this platform.

*Ex*. students, professors, teenagers, parents, etc.


The reason this project is of **interest** to me is 
because as a university student learning to manage your expenses is crucial. 
For a while now, the way I have been doing so is through the use of Excel. 
However, Excel does not have a nice friendly interface. Changing inputs and editing cells 
becomes tedious quite fast. 

With the creation of this app I intend ease the
burdens of such process.

### Phase 1 User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to add an expense 
to my list of expenses. 
2. As a user, I want to be able to add a description, dollar amount,
category, month, and year to each expense as I am adding 
them to my expense list.
3. As a user, I want to be able to view all expenses in my 
expense list. Each expense should output in format:


    description-category-amount-month-year


In addition, I want to be able to view the total money spent for ALL expenses. 


    Total Costs: $$$$


4. As a user, I want to be able to view all expenses for a 
given month. Each expense should output in format:


    description-category-amount-month-year


In addition, I want to be able to view the total money spent 
for that given MONTH. 


    Total Costs: $$$$


5. As a user, I want to be able to view total expenses
per category and per month

### Phase 2 User Stories
1. As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, 
I want to be reminded to save the changes made to my budget manager. 
2. As a user, when I start my budget manager, I want to be given
the option to load my expenses from file.
