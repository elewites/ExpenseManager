# My Personal Project

## Budget Manager

- The **intent** of this application is to provide a 
user-friendly system that helps manage one's expenses.


- The app can be **used** by a range of users.


- Anyone who is interested in having access to an easy way 
of tracking their monthly budget/expenses should use this platform.


- *Ex*. students, professors, teenagers, etc.


- This project is of **interest** to me 
because as a university student learning to manage 
your expenses makes every aspect of your academic life
much easier.


- With the creation of this app I intend ease the
burdens of such process.
