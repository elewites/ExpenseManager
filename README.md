## Budget Manager

The **intent** of the Budget Manager application is to provide a 
user-friendly system that helps manage one's expenses. Within the application
the user will be able to catalog their expenses by month and category. 
As of this moment, the categories are constrained to the following: food, rent, medical, 
clothing, and entertainment. However, in later versions of the application this will 
be updated so that the user can create their own classification categories. 

Furthermore, at any point in time, the user will be able to view the total money they 
have spent for any given month. On top of that, they can also view the total money 
spent for any given category in any given month.

As of now, the application has a console based interface. Whenever the user wants 
to see their monthly totals or monthly totals per category, the dollar amount will print
to the console. However, in later versions, the app will provide the user with 
more pleasing visualizations of their expenses (histograms, line-plots, etc.)

The app is made to be **used** by a range of users.
Anyone who is interested in having access to an easy way 
of tracking their monthly budget/expenses should be able to use this platform.

*Ex*. students, professors, teenagers, parents, etc.


The reason this project is of **interest** to me is 
because as a university student learning to manage your expenses is crucial. 
For a while now, the way I have been doing so is through the use of Excel. 
However, Excel does not have a nice friendly interface. Changing inputs and editing cells 
becomes tedious quite fast. 

With the creation of this app I intend ease the
burdens of such process.
